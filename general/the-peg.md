# The Peg

"The peg" is a metric of how close to the real world trading price of $1 kUSD is actively valued at on the open market.

### Overview

As trades happen on both centralized and decentralized exchanges (CEX and DEX), they influence the price of Tezos (XTZ). 

The main goal of Kolibri's kUSD token is to combat the ebbs and flows of XTZ and remain a stable store of value, "pegging"
its value such that 1 kUSD is always roughly equal to $1.

### "Soft Peg"

Since Kolibri relies on a system of vaults, stability fees, and liquidations to maintain its price, the price fluctuates 
*around* a dollar, depending on a number of market factors. Unlike "hard pegged" assets that are on-chain representations 
of real-world dollars in a bank account, the Kolibri protocol is a balancing act of economic policies to drive the "peg"
to equilibrium such that 1 kUSD == $1, automatically correcting for fluctuations in the underlying XTZ price.

### Peg Depth

The "Peg Depth" is a metric that gives a sense of liquidity of a market in terms of price impact and slippage. 

It's a measurement of the amount of an underlying token that needs to be bought/sold in order to push the "peg" by exactly
1%.
